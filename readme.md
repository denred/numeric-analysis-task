# Task Description

## File Information

The file contains a large set of integers, and you can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LxSB6UEAVK0NLgU0ah5y0CBbD0gL_oO9/).

## Task

Find the following four/six values:

1. Maximum number in the file.
2. Minimum number in the file.
3. Median ([details](https://goo.gl/hiCwVw)).
4. Arithmetic mean ([details](https://goo.gl/XJeAjZ)).
5. Longest sequence of increasing numbers (optional).
6. Longest sequence of decreasing numbers (optional).

## Solution Method

The proposed solution method should find all four/six values from the file in no more than 90 seconds. While this condition is optional, it would be a significant advantage if your solution meets it.

## Additional Information:

- **Median:** If the set of numbers has an even count, the median should be the average of the two middle values. For example, in the set {1, 8, 14, 19}, the median is 11 (because 0.5\*(8+14)=11).

- **Number Sequence:** It refers to the order of numbers in the file that appear consecutively. Even randomly generated data sets may have quite long sequences. For example, an increasing sequence could look like: -4390, -503, 3, 16, 5032.
